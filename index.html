                <p> Hello, Liam here!
Letter
                    I'm a solutions-oriented UX/UI Designer with a passion for improving efficiencies and making things look pretty. I primarily work with digital interfaces like webpages and mobile apps on computers and phones, but I love a good challenge with other mediums.
                    My process begins with extensive research and empathy of my clients and the products’ users to identify goals, challenges, and user behaviours to propose potential solutions. This process is supported by my background in Psychology, Recruitment (interviews), and of course, Design Thinking. In this process, I will ask lots of questions! 
                    I will then develop, design, and test the solutions to ensure they’re the right solutions for my clients. After all,  “Solutions” aren’t solutions unless they meet client/business needs & tackle the core issues!
                    I take a consultative and collaborative approach - I will be your partner every step of the way to ensure your product is of the highest caliber.
